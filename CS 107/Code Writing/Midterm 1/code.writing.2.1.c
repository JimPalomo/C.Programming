/*
      The formula for computing windchill, where T is temperature and W is wind speed, is:
      windchill = 35.7 + 0.6T â€“ 35.7W0.16 + 0.43TW0.16
      Write a function called windChill() that accepts T and W as parameters, and returns the computed windchill.
      Assume that the appropriate libraries have been included (i.e. #include <math.h> is at the top of the file).
      double windchill(double T, double W){

      }
