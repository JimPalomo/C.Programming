 /*
      Create a simple program that reads in current and resistance of a circuit and calculates the voltage across the circuit. Your program should:

      prompt the user to first enter the current measured in the circuit
      read in the current and store into an appropriate variable
      prompt the user to enter the resistance of the circuit
      read in the resistance and store into an appropriate variable
      calculate the voltage across the circuit (recall this is calculated by multiplying the current by the resistance)
      display the voltage in the circuit in a readable form with appropriate labels
*/

#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
   
   float current;
   int resistance;
   
   printf("Enter the current and resistance measured in the circuit: \n");
   scanf("%f %d\n", &current, &resistance);
   printf("The current measured is and the resistance is %f Amps %d Ohms\n", current, resistance);
   printf("the voltage across the circuit is %lf V\n", current*resistance);
   
   return 0;
